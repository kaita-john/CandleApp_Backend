    <h1>StarPal Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>StarPal</strong>! By using our platform, you agree to the following terms and conditions. Please read them carefully before proceeding. These terms govern your use of the StarPal app and services, including video calls, voice chats, and personalized messages with celebrities.</p>

    <h2>1. Platform Role and Limitations</h2>
    <p>StarPal acts solely as a facilitator to connect users with celebrities. We do not control, monitor, or take responsibility for the content or nature of communication between users and celebrities.

StarPal is not liable for any outcomes resulting from these interactions.</p>

    <h2>2. No In-Person Meetups</h2>
    <p>StarPal strictly advises against in-person meetups between users and celebrities as a result of interactions on the platform. The app is designed for virtual connections only, and any offline meetings are at the sole risk and discretion of the involved parties. StarPal is not responsible for any consequences arising from such meetups.</p>

    <h2>3. One-on-One Interactions</h2>
    <p>Users are not permitted to allow third parties to join video calls or voice chats unless explicitly agreed upon by the celebrity. All interactions are intended to be one-on-one unless otherwise approved by the celebrity.</p>

    <h2>4. Prohibition of Exploitation</h2>
    <p>Celebrities are prohibited from exploiting users in any way, including but not limited to financial, emotional, or psychological exploitation. Any such behavior should be reported to StarPal immediately for investigation.</p>

    <h2>6. Call Disconnections</h2>
    <p>StarPal is not responsible for call disconnections or technical issues that may occur during interactions. While we strive to provide a seamless experience, factors such as internet connectivity, device performance, or other external issues may affect the quality or duration of calls.</p>

    <h2>7. Celebrity Payment Terms</h2>
    <p>Celebrities agree to accept the payment percentage allocated to them as per StarPal’s payment structure. Any disputes regarding payments must be resolved directly with StarPal, and celebrities are bound by the terms agreed upon during their onboarding process.</p>

    <h2>8. Payment Processing</h2>
    <p>Payments to celebrities may be delayed due to necessary verification processes to ensure the service was completed satisfactorily. StarPal reserves the right to withhold payments until verification is complete.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact Exchange</h2>
    <p>StarPal strongly recommends against the exchange of personal contact information (e.g., phone numbers, email addresses, or social media handles) between users and celebrities. Any such exchanges are at the user’s and celebrity’s own risk, and StarPal is not responsible for any consequences arising from such actions.</p>

    <h2>10. Call Duration and Satisfaction</h2>
    <p>Celebrities are expected to maintain a reasonable call duration to ensure fan satisfaction. Prematurely ending calls without providing adequate interaction is discouraged and may result in penalties or removal from the platform.</p>

    <h2>11. User Conduct</h2>
    <p>Users and celebrities are expected to maintain respectful and appropriate behavior during all interactions. Any form of harassment, abuse, or inappropriate conduct will result in immediate account suspension or termination.</p>

    <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>StarPal is not liable for any damages, losses, or claims arising from the use of the platform, including but not limited to technical issues, user or celebrity misconduct, or third-party actions. Users and celebrities agree to use the platform at their own risk.</p>

    <h2>13. Modifications to Terms</h2>
    <p>StarPal reserves the right to modify these Terms of Service at any time. Users will be notified of any changes, and continued use of the platform constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>
